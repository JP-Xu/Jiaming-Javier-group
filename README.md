# Python codes
1. Sigma profile and net charge_final.ipynb
       The code to generate sigma profiles for ionic liquids by computing the results coming
    from Material Studio COSMO analysis. The remaining net charge of those sigma profiles are also
    determined by using this code.
   
2. Regression_final.ipynb
      The code manages the generated sigma profiles by ascribing their tendency to a second order
    polynomial regression.
    
3. Sensitivity analysis_final.ipynb
      One-at-time approach, scatter plots and Morris method sensitivity analysis are generated by this code.
      
4. GAMMA-generator.ipynb
      This code reports the activity coefficients for binary mixtures with different mole fractions and
    temperatures. However, the code requires long time to generate the activity confident and its accuracy
    was not validated by comparing with literature results.
